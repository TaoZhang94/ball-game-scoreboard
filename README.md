Background
At sporting evens it is no longer unusual to see large digital scoring systems used to both record scores and display them to the audience. These are often very expensive. We're going to look at creating a budget system that can be used in schools with a simple Windows computer and a projector. The pan is to run the computer using two screens, one extending the desktop. The first screen - on the laptop - will display a window in which you will enter team names and members before the match, and track the scores of both teams in real time once the match has begun. The second screen - the projector - will show a clear and easy to read summary, consisting the teams and member names and the current score as explained below.

Scoring
The sport - named Aerial Assist for our purposes - is played by two teams of five people. There is one large ball which needs to be passed from person to person before finally going through the team's goal, one on either end of the field. If a team scores a goal they get 5 points. However, the field is broken up into four zones, and each time the team passes to another player within a different zone, they score 1 bonus point, for a maximum of 3 points. Importantly, if the ball is intercepted by the other team before they finally score, the bonus points are not scored and the count is reset. Each round lasts for 10 minutes, there are 3 rounds per match.

As some examples, assume two teams, one of which (Team A) is made up of Kathy, Grant, Kirsten, Jo and Doug. On the opposing side we have (Team B) Wolfgang, Stewart, Lin Liu, Ross and Michael.

In round one, the ball starts with Team A at their defensive end. Jo takes the ball, and passes it to Grant who is in Zone 2 for 1 bonus point. Grant passes back to Kirsten in Zone 1 (no change in score, it started in Zone 1) who goes for a high throw to Doug in Zone 3. Doug catches the ball (2 potential bonus points), and quickly passes to Jo, who has run forward into Zone 4 (3 potential points). She scores a goal, for a total of 8 points (5 for the goal, 3 bonus).

The ball then goes to Team B, who start with Ross. Ross goes for the long throw to Michael in Zone 3, who quickly throws it to back to Lin Liu in Zone 2. Thus they get two potential bonus points - one for the pass to Michael and one for the pass to Lin Liu. She makes a perfect throw to Stewart in Zone 4, but before Stewart catches the ball it is grabbed by the quick defense of Grant for Team A. This resets the bonus points for Team B back to 0. Grant passes to Doug but the pass is poor and Wolfgang intercepts. Wolfgang makes a long and perfect throw and goals, but because the bonus points were reset after the intercept, Team B only scores 5 points, with the score now at 8 to 5.
